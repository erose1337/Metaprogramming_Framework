Currently working on: Homescreen

To Do/Bugs
=====

Homescreen
----------
- set up homescreen
- set up application launcher
    - /usr/share/applications/
- set up system shell
- set up python shell
- set up file explorer
    - right click menu should contain open-file-explorer-here-as-root option


text alpha slider still not working
-----------------------------------
- reproducible: ?(describe how, if possible)
- screenshot: highlight the problem


full screen toggle, resolution sliders
--------------------------------------
- started: windowoptions


make proper file selector with directory viewer
-----------------------------------------------
- different views (details, tiles)
- clicking on filename opens detailed information about the file
- display current directory
- change current directory
    - back/forward buttons, up button
    - address bar
- started: fileexplorer


optimize render
---------------
- cache every x layers
- batch draw rects of the same color and depth
- when re-drawing an object, check to see if another object with that size and profile has been drawn
- give each window object a texture to cache the result of its drawing
    - can share textures from objects of the same size, theme, and theme profile
- don't draw occluded objects
- if a window object creates a child and that child does not have limited size, then the window object is not visible
    - only if the children are opaque


create Animations
-----------------
- draw each frame and cache it ahead of time
    - must be done after component is organized
- copy cached frame to screen when rendering

2d slider pad
-------------
- useful for e.g. changing position


Tip Bar
-------
- set timeout on tip bar text?
- implement colors in tip bar text?


autoreferences
--------------
- finish converting autoreferences:
    - do tabs/window
    - do sdl_window


indicate unusable buttons as being unusable (e.g. grey-out)
-----------------------------------------------------------
- fade-out effects for hide/show
- hide/show buttons
    - mouseover to left/right/top/bottom to see hide/show buttons


theme designer applet
---------------------
- visual programming app to make designing themes easy


improve auto-documentation (pride.components.package)
-----------------------------------------------------
- how?


add api file + start using versionhelper
----------------------------------------
- separate gui into separate package due to different levels of stability


change user.encrypt to use a per-cryptogram key to avoid dealing with nonces
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- use a random salt in user2.User.derive_master_keys


deal with certificates properly
-------------------------------
- ...


Ideas
=====

post-initializer inheritance
----------------------------
- append each post-initializer into a list
- call them all in succession


auto remove Base objects from lists (or containers)
---------------------------------------------------
- add_to method that adds a Base object to a list
- #self.append_to(list)
- #   keeps a handle on list
-   on delete, removes `self` from list


Software install module
-----------------------

def install_packages(install_script)
    if pride.components.shell.get_permission(prompt):
        os.system(install_script)


Changes
=======
- changed audiolibrary code to perform fewer calls and return True when software is successfully installed
    - create
Notes
=====

RPC acted weird on first run, then worked fine?
-----------------------------------------------
- reproducible: ?


Known Issues
============

encryptedstorage does not have OS provided encryption on linux
--------------------------------------------------------------
- there is no equivalent on linux
- just switch providers if using linux
